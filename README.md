## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for code exploration)
- Required Python packages (can be installed using `pip`):
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/lavansasmi/2111_Madha_Engineering_college_prediction-of-house-prices-using-machine-learning

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   

3. Install the required Python packages:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Data Preparation

1. Obtain the house price dataset. This dataset should include features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and of course, the sale prices.

2. Place the dataset in the project directory.

3. Load and preprocess the dataset in your Jupyter Notebook or Python script. The `data_preparation.ipynb` notebook in the project directory can be a useful reference for this step.

## Training the Model

1. Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data. The `train_model.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to train the model.

2. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve model performance. Cross-validation can be useful for this purpose.

## Testing the Model

1. Evaluate the model's performance using a test dataset. The `test_model.ipynb` notebook explains how to do this.

2. Calculate relevant metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy.

## Usage

Once you have trained and tested the model, you can use it to predict house prices by providing the required input features.

python
# Import the trained model (e.g., in a Python script)
from joblib import load

# Load the trained model
model = load("trained_model.joblib")

# Provide input features as a list or NumPy array
input_features = [4, 2000, "Desirable Neighborhood"]

# Make a prediction
predicted_price = model.predict([input_features])

print(f"Predicted Price: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")

This README file provides a structured guide for setting up and running a house price detection project using machine learning. 
## Overview

This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features of houses. The model uses a dataset of historical house prices and their corresponding features to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing. It is a collection of real estate data, including information on house characteristics, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and sale prices. You can download the dataset from the Kaggle link and place it in the project directory for data preparation.
